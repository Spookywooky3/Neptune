# Neptune

React Native app which uses my implementation of the ZHL-16C decompression algorithm to predict nitrogen tissue saturation over the time of a scuba dive and plan the required stops to meet safe inert tissue pressures to ascend to the surface.

This is a still very much under the way project, with **plans to implement helium and hydrogen tissue saturation** as well as support for gas redundancy and closed-circuit rebreathers.
